# Examples of extended formatting

*** NOTE*** These don't all seem to display on github pages same as they do on github preview. 


## H2 header
One of my favourite Cockerell Quotes:
> Do what you say you're gonna do.

### H3 header
Here is a table (I haven't included any backticks, note)

First Name | Last Name
------------ | -------------
Vincent | Price
Christopher | Lee
Peter | Cushing


#### H4 header
An example of inline code is `$ git push`.

***NOTE*** This requires a back tick *NOT* a single quote `'` !

##### H5 header
Here is a separate code block. Must use back tick not single quote.

Remember formatting doesn't apply here:

```
git pull
git branch my-branch
git checkout my-branch
Some *formatting that doesn't apply*. Here is a backtick `.
```

###### H6 header
Here will be an example of dropdown:

<details>
	<summary>Click me</summary>
	
	This is a bit more info that is quite useless.

</details>

### Another section

This ~~is a checkable list~~ might be a checkable list:

- [x] First item is done
- [] Finish course
- [] Submit code changes :tada:

#### Footnote example
Here I will add a footnote[^1]

[^1]: Pointless footnote.
