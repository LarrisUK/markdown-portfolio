# Examples of extended formatting

## H2 header
One of my favourite Cockerell Quotes:
> Do what you say you're gonna do.

### H3 header
Here is a table
```
First Name | Last Name
------------ | -------------
Vincent | Price
Christopher | Lee
Peter | Cushing
```

#### H4 header
An example of inine code is '$ git push'.

##### H5 header
Here is a separate code block. Remember formatting doesn't apply here:
'''
git pull
git branch my-branch
git checkout my-branch
Some *formatting that doesn't apply*
'''

###### H6 header
Here will be an example of dropdown:

<details>
	<summary>More Info</summary>
	
	This is a bit more info that is quite useless.

</details>

### Another section

This ~~is~~ might be a checkable list:

- [x] First item is done
- [] Finish course
- [] Submit code changes :tada:

#### Footnote example
Here I will add a footnote[^1]

[^1]: Pointless footnote.
